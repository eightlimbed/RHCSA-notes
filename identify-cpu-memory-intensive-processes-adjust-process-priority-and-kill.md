## Identify CPU/Memory Intensive Processes, Adjust Process Priority and Kill Processes
- `pgrep`
- `pkill`
- default `kill` is SIGTERM (15) and its "nice". It allows the process to finish before it is terminated.
- `kill -SIGKILL` (9) is immediate
- SIGHUP, hangup, is used to configure/reload the controlling process of a terminal. Its what happens when you click the X in the upper corner of a window.
- SIGINT == C-c
- SIGSTOP cannot be ignored
- SIGTSTP can be ignored
- !! start using `w` !!
- `jobs` shows what background processes are running
- `ps axo pid,comm,nice` -> cool way to format the ps display
- "Nice Level" - the niceness of a process
- niceness means the priority to CPU utilization
- LOWER niceness = higher priority
- `ps -u` -> linux/POSIX syntax
- `ps u`  -> BSD syntax
- both have different behavior
- If you are running a web server, like httpd, you might want to set the niceness level of the httpd processes to have a higher priority in order to optimize!
- niceness level ranges from -20 to 19
- it's like priority mail
